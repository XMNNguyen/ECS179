------
*Necromancer's Burden* is a roguelike action game where the player controls a Necromancer who's dog Lucky has just died of old age.

Defeat various enemies to collect their souls and become more powerful. Unlock new abilities to aid when exploring the world and confronting challenging bosses. Embark on a dangerous and certainly not justified murder rampage so Lucky can bark once again!
