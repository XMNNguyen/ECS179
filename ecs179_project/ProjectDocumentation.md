## Producer - Ian O'Connell

Much of the scheduling responsibilities were a coordinated effort involving all members of the group. Everyone attended and contributed to all the group meetings. We had our initial plan meeting which involved mostly brainstorming and setting some basic goals for what we wanted to accomplish. In hindsight these goals were a bit ambitious but it's better to aim high than low. We had another group meeting to create the progress report where we assessed where we were at and set some new more realistic and attainable goals. The goals we set in the progress report were accomplished over the following week or two. Throughout this process we utilized discord as our priamry form of communication where we frequently communicated about what we were working on, what kinds of decisions we were making, and what we needed to do next.

We used a clickup list to clearly display the goals set at the progress report meeting (Martin's idea). Contributions to the repository were done methodically and one at a time to ensure there were no conflicts between the work done by different group members. We also divided the work in ways that made collisions less likely. We never had to deal with any issues within the repository.

I managed uploading the web playable version of the game on itch.io which can be found at https://braxai.itch.io/necromancers-burden. 

I worked on the map. Building the level the player would navigate and discussing ideas behind what enemies would be present, where they would be, and how the boss fit into the level. I helped collect asset packs and develop the visual direction the game was going. This included finding the terrain packs, the dog pack, the packs used for the boss and the packs for some of the enemies.

### Game Feel

Note: Other team members also found assets to use. 

To establish a cohesive game feel, we selected assets from free resources that harmonize stylistically, maintaining a consistent level of detail as best as we could. Since our game can have many enemies and projectiles on screen at once, it was important to choose enemies and projectiles that could be quickly and clearly seen to keep the game feeling fair. This meant enemies needed to have distinct silohettes and colors while still fiting with the visual style. 

### Visual Style

We decided early on in development that we did not want this game to take itself too seriously, which we wanted to reflect in the visual style. This also worked in our favor while working with free assets as assets that slightly clashed with one another only added to the this goal of a not super serious game. 

The setting our game is a magical forest filled with a wide range of creatures. The main visual style was built around the tilemap that we found early on into development. All characters and items found throughout the game were selected with the tilemap in mind.  We initally planned on adding different environments, keeping the same style while introducing new textures, but due to time limitations we settled on the single environment. 

### World Building

I helped build the main world and built the island where the introduction cutscene takes place. One issue we noticed during play-testing was that some players had trouble following the linear level to the end. To address this problem we focused on making the scenary, like trees and bushes, better outline the intended path. This dense foliage outlining the path creates an immersive environment that also works toward leading the player in the right direction. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c650d40-8dd8-46c7-b915-a7a0d419f07a)

I also utilied Godot's particle system to create smoke and energy effects that are used during cutscenes. I wanted to establish that magic was a part of this world early on as the transition into firing magical orbs at the start of the gameplay felt a bit drastic without further context.

## User Interface and Input - Jason Gao

Inputs:

-WASD for movement

-(space) to interact

-Mouse right click for interactions for press() in home screen, control screen, death screen and credits screen.

Starting, Controls, Death, and Credits Screen:

In all of these scenes, they use the same button graphic and functionality. The background of these scenes were photoshopped and implemented using the panel node in godot.

![image](https://github.com/XMNNguyen/ECS179/blob/18aee89737581bd5729f492e1759206b0f40f1c6/ecs179_project/READMEassets/Start_Screen.jpg)

Player Hearts:

The player has 8 hearts and has indices of 0.5, which totals to 16 health. Every time the health is at an odd number, it will display a half heart. The hearts are contained in a HBoxContainer so that each heart can be equally indented and individually customized by updating each individual child(each heart by frames in the sprite sheet) with indexes. This acts as a way to identify how much health is left. 

![image](https://github.com/XMNNguyen/ECS179/blob/18aee89737581bd5729f492e1759206b0f40f1c6/ecs179_project/READMEassets/Hearts_UI.jpg)

Souls Counter:

The soul is made by using a label node and an AnimatedSprite2D within a CanvasLayer. The label has a script that shows the amount of souls collected by getting the global script of souls_counter. This Graphic is used to determine how many souls you have collected, and how much you need to get the next ability.

Ability Cooldowns:

Much like the Player Hearts, the graphics for the ability cooldowns are also in a HBoxContainer, and each ability’s cooldown and graphic are updated through the indices of children. This is to help the player know when certain abilities are up to auto fire, so that it can be used for desired purposes, such as getting close to the boss when the shotgun ability is going to be up.

## Movement - Physics - Cyrus Azad
Note: Even though this was my main role, there were aspects that everyone worked together on. 

The movement and physics in our game are very simple. The player is given 8 directional movement using the WASD keyboard keys, using the standard Godot movement systems of velocity and move_and_slide() in order to implement this. We had to make functions for the player to be able to move over a slope smoothly, which was done by finding the tile data and adding a movement bias based on the input direction of the player and the type of slope they were on. We also added a helper function adjust_z_index to help keep the player walking on the surface instead of walking through the slopes and disappearing. 

The enemy movement was implemented the same way, except instead of inputting directions the enemies locked on to and followed the player once the player was in range. We used vectors in order to calculate the direction of the player in reference to the given enemy so that the enemy knew which direction to move and/or attack. We also implemented different attacks for each enemy. Every time the player gets hit by an enemy attack, there is a stunlock where the movement of all enemies and players pauses, and there is an audio queue and camera shake in order to signify to the player that they took damage. The chicken starts a wind up timer once in attack range, and then launches it’s body at the player’s current position as a charge peck attack towards the player at a very increased velocity. The sprout fires a projectile at a given bullet_velocity in the direction of the player. For the troll, we made their attack very similar to the chicken with a wind up and charge, however when the troll hits the player it grabs them, stunning the player for a time given by the stun_timer. We made a signal to show the player that they are stunned and made the player have to be idle until the stun_timer is over. The boss attack is the same as the sprout’s in its movement and physics, but with different animation and stronger stats. 

We also implemented different attacks with different physics mechanics. The base standard bullet simply fires a projectile at the nearest enemy. The shotgun weapon finds the nearest enemy, and then converts a given shotgun angle into radians, with the center of the angle being the location of the nearest enemy. It then divides the angle into different sections based on how many shotgun bullets there are, and fires the bullets in a spread shot within the angle given. The wave bullet is more of a pulse, as it uses vectors to send a short range wave of energy in each diagonal direction of the player, not accounting for enemy position at all. The chain bullet was very interesting to implement, as it shoots a bullet at the nearest enemy similar to the standard bullet, but then once an enemy is hit, it uses the enemy’s global position to find the next nearest enemy, and calculates if it is within a range of bounce_distance. If the enemy is within the range, the bullet then bounces and hits that next enemy, and then repeats for a given number of bounces.

## Press Kit and Trailer - Ian O'Connell

I originally had a lot of apprehension with this role as I don't have much experience with the tools that are involved in developing a press kit and trailer. However, after going through the process of developing the game and creatively deciding how to best represent the decisions we made throughout that process I found this to be an enjoyable experience and am satisfied with the result.

### Press Kit
- [Press Kit](https://braxai.itch.io/necromancers-burden-presskit)
- I used itch.io to implement the press kit. I wanted the press kit to be as simple as possible and with us having implemented only the first major region of the game there isn't too much need for an extensive set of screenshots to represent the gameplay as is. I included an image of the home screen showing off some of the nice user interface work done by my teammates. Images of the Necromancer played by the character and Lucky the dog who serves as the motivation for the character's decision making are included. Finally a couple screenshots show what the gameplay can look like. A short summary gives the quick baseline of what the game is all about. Some simple information about the game and necessary methods to download and play the game are included as well. 

### Trailer 
- [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UQKqACdcuU)
- I wanted the trailer to have a somewhat ominous feel to match the idea that the Necromancer isn't necessarily a good guy. He is on a quest to bring Lucky back to life by any means necessary, including harvesting souls of the innovent. I found some spooky dark music to play in the background. It starts slow with the audio lower and builds up throughout the trailer. I tried to capture the idea that the Necromancer is an imposing character, collecting souls to become more powerful. The largest unbroken chunk of the trailer is the gameplay footage showing off what the enemies look like, how the attacks function, and what someone can expect when playing Necromancer's Burden. Then it fades out utilizing empty black screens and emphasizing the goal of bringing Lucky back. The audio volumne increases and syncs with the music to reveal the game title Necromacner's Burden at the end. The trailer is simple but gets across the main feelings intended to be included in the game.

### Game Balance

### Visual Clutter Balance

## Narrative Design - Charlie Edwards

I utlized the Godot plugin Dialogue Manager to assist with creating dialogue and to have the option for branching dialogue trees. [Source](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/tree/main), [License](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/blob/main/LICENSE)

Dialogue Manager lets me manage all of the game's dialogue in a single text file, where I can sequentially call dialogue and functions. Once implemented, it gave me a simple, systematic way of implementing new dialogue with the option for branching dialogue. This is done by creating an Actionable node that has a CollisionShape2D as a child. I found this [general tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhPFk8FSbd8) and this [cutscene tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_TN8jz4v9o) by the creator of the plugin very useful. Since we do not have any voice acting, I used pictures in the dialogue box to show who is talking.

![dialogue1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7be66754-a455-4856-927c-43ce2c6433d3)

The player is allowed to move during dialogue because some signs, containing dialogue, are placed where enemies may be present; so we decided it was best to always let the player move during dialogue. 

The introduction cutscene gives the context of the game and makes it clear early on that this is a light-hearted game, not meant to be taken too seriously. The death of the dog, Lucky, establishes the motivation of the Necromancer's rampage and shows how despicably evil the boss is. We wanted something early on in the story to grab the player's attention and utlize most people's love for animals as motivation to complete the game, reuniting the Necromancer and Lucky. 

I also chose to put an interactable sign right after the first cutscene, at the start of the gameplay, to build ituition in the player to interact with any futures signs they see as interacting with a sign is necessary in order to start the boss fight later.

<img width="400" alt="first sign1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c6e126-10e5-4bf6-9b75-715a8b82cb1d" />


This first sign just has a simple beware of enemies message that serves to warn the player of future enemies, but mainly is there to make the player want to interact with signs. The second sign is found right before the boss fight and while disguised as just another warning sign, starts the boss fight.

## Audio - Jason Gao

For the audio, I made a scene that contains all of the audio used and set it as auto load, that way the audio can be accessed anywhere throughout the scripts. For most of the audio I found online, I had edited it in Audacity to fit the run time and how it fits with the gameplay. The sound style is made with a bit of realism, where the sound changes depending on what terrain type you are on. This is implemented by creating custom data in the tile map, where the water tiles and ground tiles are identified as different integers. There are sfx where the enemy and player shoots, also when they get hit, making it more engaging and interactive.
