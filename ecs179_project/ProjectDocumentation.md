## Producer - Ian O'Connell

Much of the scheduling responsibilities were a coordinated effort involving all members of the group. Everyone attended and contributed to all the group meetings. We had our initial plan meeting which involved mostly brainstorming and setting some basic goals for what we wanted to accomplish. In hindsight these goals were a bit ambitious but it's better to aim high than low. We had another group meeting to create the progress report where we assessed where we were at and set some new more realistic and attainable goals. The goals we set in the progress report were accomplished over the following week or two. Throughout this process we utilized discord as our priamry form of communication where we frequently communicated about what we were working on, what kinds of decisions we were making, and what we needed to do next.

We used a clickup list to clearly display the goals set at the progress report meeting (Martin's idea). Contributions to the repository were done methodically and one at a time to ensure there were no conflicts between the work done by different group members. We also divided the work in ways that made collisions less likely. We never had to deal with any issues within the repository.

I managed uploading the web playable version of the game on itch.io which can be found at https://braxai.itch.io/necromancers-burden. 

I worked on the map. Building the level the player would navigate and discussing ideas behind what enemies would be present, where they would be, and how the boss fit into the level. I helped collect asset packs and develop the visual direction the game was going. This included finding the terrain packs, the dog pack, the packs used for the boss and the packs for some of the enemies.

## Press Kit and Trailer - Ian O'Connell

I originally had a lot of apprehension with this role as I don't have much experience with the tools that are involved in developing a press kit and trailer. However, after going through the process of developing the game and creatively deciding how to best represent the decisions we made throughout that process I found this to be an enjoyable experience and am satisfied with the result.

### Press Kit
- [Press Kit](https://braxai.itch.io/necromancers-burden-presskit)
- I used itch.io to implement the press kit. I wanted the press kit to be as simple as possible and with us having implemented only the first major region of the game there isn't too much need for an extensive set of screenshots to represent the gameplay as is. I included an image of the home screen showing off some of the nice user interface work done by my teammates. Images of the Necromancer played by the character and Lucky the dog who serves as the motivation for the character's decision making are included. Finally a couple screenshots show what the gameplay can look like. A short summary gives the quick baseline of what the game is all about. Some simple information about the game and necessary methods to download and play the game are included as well. 

### Trailer 
- [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UQKqACdcuU)
- I wanted the trailer to have a somewhat ominous feel to match the idea that the Necromancer isn't necessarily a good guy. He is on a quest to bring Lucky back to life by any means necessary, including harvesting souls of the innovent. I found some spooky dark music to play in the background. It starts slow with the audio lower and builds up throughout the trailer. I tried to capture the idea that the Necromancer is an imposing character, collecting souls to become more powerful. The largest unbroken chunk of the trailer is the gameplay footage showing off what the enemies look like, how the attacks function, and what someone can expect when playing Necromancer's Burden. Then it fades out utilizing empty black screens and emphasizing the goal of bringing Lucky back. The audio volumne increases and syncs with the music to reveal the game title Necromacner's Burden at the end. The trailer is simple but gets across the main feelings intended to be included in the game.
